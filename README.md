- 👋 Hi, I’m Jonathan Koranteng (@Jkrant48)
- 👀 I’m interested in web and software development. I also love music and play the piano in my free time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web development which builds gradually into a software development degree.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any software or web project that will put my kills to the test and
- help me learn more. Skills so far: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and C# (Still a beginner but I am working very hard.)
- 📫 How to reach me: email: jkoranteng@gmail.com/IG: Jay_krant
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love learning new things and I am trying hard to develop a skill in graphic design and
- video editing.
